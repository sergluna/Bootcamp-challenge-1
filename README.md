# Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description

The repository for Challenge 1 of my Web Development bootcamp. Here you will find the html and css file required for submission.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To view my submission please review the index.html and style.css file. When inspecting the html code you will see semantic html tags being used inplace of div tags. This increases the web page accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation. When reviewing the css file you will see some css rules have been consolidated to reduce lines and increase efficiency. In addition to consolidating lines of code, comments have been added to describe the styling of each css rule.
